This repository collects random patches I have made for NetHack that are either
pulled from SpliceHack, updates of out-of-date and abandoned patches, or things
that do not fit in with any variants I am developing.
* RocketHack: Inspired by the Angband April fools variant RocketBand.
  Essentially, all monsters get rocket launchers and explosive rockets. You can
  get them too. Guaranteed to develop into absolute chaos. Coded in roughly an
  hour, please do not take this seriously or try to ascend with it.
  Breaks saves, obviously.
